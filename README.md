## About

This API is a personal project to **learn Go**, specifically focusing on building APIs using **gRPC** and **GraphQL**. It's a sandbox to practice and explore backend patterns and tooling.

## Goals

- Understand and apply Go fundamentals
- Learn how to build and structure gRPC + GraphQL APIs
- Experiment with modular architecture and clean code
- Gain hands-on experience with concurrency, error handling, etc.
- and Tests(all kinds of them)

## Notes

- This is **not** intended for production use
- Built purely for **learning and experimentation**
- Might eventually be used by a React native app?
